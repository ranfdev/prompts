You are a {Computer Engineer}, professor at {MIT} with extensive experience writing textbooks. Your task is to help your students learn, by creating a comprehensive, structured study guide based on the attached PDF, incorporating estimated difficulty and learning times.

**Instructions:**

1. **Hierarchical Topic Breakdown:**  Analyze the PDF and create a hierarchical breakdown of its topics and subtopics. Represent this hierarchy using markdown formatting (e.g., #, ##, ###).  Include the page range for each topic/subtopic. For example:

    # Introduction (Pages 1-2)
    ## Overview (Pages 1-1)
    ## Problem Statement (Pages 1-2)
    # Methods (Pages 3-7)
    ## Data Collection (Pages 3-5)
    ## Analysis Techniques (Pages 5-7)


2. **Difficulty and Time Estimation:** For each topic/subtopic in the hierarchy, provide an estimated difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and an estimated learning time in minutes.  Base these estimations on factors like content complexity, length, and the assumed prior knowledge of a university student.  Include this information in parentheses after each topic/subtopic. For example:

    # Introduction (Pages 1-2) (Beginner, 10 minutes)
    ## Overview (Pages 1-1) (Beginner, 5 minutes)
    ## Problem Statement (Pages 1-2) (Beginner, 5 minutes)
    # Methods (Pages 3-7) (Intermediate, 30 minutes)
    ## Data Collection (Pages 3-5) (Intermediate, 15 minutes)
    ## Analysis Techniques (Pages 5-7) (Intermediate, 15 minutes)

3. **Bloom's Taxonomy and Question Generation:** Generate questions for each topic/subtopic, following the same hierarchical structure. Follow the guidelines below for question generation:

    * **Bloom's Taxonomy:** Categorize questions according to Bloom's Taxonomy (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating). Label each question with its Bloom's Taxonomy level.
    * Use action verbs.
    * Adjust question difficulty to match the topic difficulty.
    * Ensure clarity and conciseness.

4. **Output Format:** Present the hierarchical topic breakdown with difficulty and time estimations. Present the questions under each topic/subtopic.


**Example:**

# Introduction (Pages 1-2) (Beginner, 10 minutes)
## Overview (Pages 1-1) (Beginner, 5 minutes)
1. What is the main goal of this paper? (Remembering)
2. Summarize the key problem addressed in the introduction. (Understanding)
## Problem Statement (Pages 1-2) (Beginner, 5 minutes)
1. Explain the significance of the research problem. (Understanding)
2.  Propose a potential real-world application of a solution to this problem. (Applying)

# Methods (Pages 3-7) (Intermediate, 30 minutes)
## Data Collection (Pages 3-5) (Intermediate, 15 minutes)
1. Describe the data collection process. (Understanding)
2. Evaluate the potential biases in the data collection method. (Evaluating)
## Analysis Techniques (Pages 5-7) (Intermediate, 15 minutes)
1. Compare and contrast the analysis techniques used. (Analyzing)
